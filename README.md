# Binary to Decimal Converter

This is a simple C program that converts a binary number (entered as a string) into its decimal equivalent.

## What It Does

- Takes a binary number input from the user (up to 64 bits).
- Checks whether the input contains only `0` and `1` characters.
- Converts the binary input to its decimal form.
- Displays the result, or an error if input is invalid.
